    <h3>
        Welcome to my Homepage!
    </h3>
    <p>
        My name is ADITYA, and I am currently a first year computer science student at RPTU Kaiserslautern, Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since my childhood I am fascinated with computers. Now I have the opportunity to understand everything, slowly but surely. I always loved to assemble computer. From Pentium 4 to currently AMD Ryzen 5600h and from integrated Graphics to Nvidia RTX 4060. It is a hell of a journey. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Not to mention from 2G/3G dongle to currently 100 MBPS connection. This website was supposed to be live for at least 10 year ago, but there is a teeny-tiny difference between localhost and an integrated server.
    </p>
    <p>
        My current GOAL is to complete my bachelors and 
        <a href="https://www.bytebeginner.com"> my project website </a> , which is still under construction. This website will contain all my projects and blogs. My Flagship project is a game based on Four Elements (inspired by Avatar) and will be hosted soon on this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are still here, maybe you are here to know me. Best way is to start with my social media.
    </p>
